  <h2>Welcome !!</h2>
  <p>I'm Anu Choudhary, a professional artist and passionate art educator. Since 2013, I’ve been guiding aspiring artists of all ages to express themselves through drawing, painting, and mixed media.</p>
  <p>Through my academy, I offer fun, inspiring, and skill-building art classes designed for kids, teens, and adults—whether you're picking up a brush for the first time or looking to grow as an artist.</p>
  <p>Take a look at my <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> to see some of my work and student creations, or <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a> to learn more about joining a class.</p>

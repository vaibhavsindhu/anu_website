      <strong class="text-yellow-300">Art has always been my language</strong> — a space where silence speaks, colors breathe, and every stroke carries a story.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m <strong class="text-yellow-300">Anu Choudhary</strong>, a visual artist with a Master’s in Fine Arts from the Government College of Art, Chandigarh, India. I’m a professional artist and a dedicated art educator with over a decade of experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since 2012, I have been nurturing creativity through my own institute — <strong class="text-yellow-300">AFAD</strong> (Academy of Fine Arts and Design), an academy dedicated to mentoring aspiring artists and designers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you're a beginner or a budding professional, my academy offers a space where creativity is cultivated with care, discipline, and imagination. I’ve been teaching and inspiring students of all ages to explore their creativity through drawing, painting, and mixed media.
    </p>

    <p>
      What began as a personal love for art has grown into a thriving art academy, where I now guide budding artists on their creative journeys.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 text-center">
      I believe art is for everyone — and every artist's voice matters.

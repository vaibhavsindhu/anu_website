      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Anu Choudhary — a passionate artist and founder of Academy Of Fine Arts and Design.</p>
      <p>Art has been an important part of my life for as long as I can remember, and in 2013, I turned that passion into a profession by starting my journey as an art teacher. Since then, I’ve been fortunate to teach and mentor hundreds of students through my art academy, helping them explore their creativity and grow as artists.</p>
      <p>At Academy Of Fine Arts and Design, I offer art classes for children, teens, and adults of all skill levels. Whether it's drawing, painting, or experimenting with mixed media, my focus is always on building strong artistic foundations while encouraging each student’s unique style and imagination.</p>
      <p>My approach to teaching is patient, supportive, and hands-on. I truly believe that art is for everyone — and that with the right guidance, anyone can create something beautiful.</p>
      <p>When I’m not teaching, I spend my time working on my own art projects and exploring new ideas and techniques to bring into the classroom.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my website — I look forward to creating with you!</p>
